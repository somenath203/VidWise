## Note

> For accurate video analysis, it is recommended that the presenter speaks in the uploaded video. This is because the analysis often relies on audio components, such as speech, to extract meaningful insights and context. Without spoken content, the analysis may miss critical information or focus solely on visual elements, which can limit its overall effectiveness.
